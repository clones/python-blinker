Blinker
=======

Blinker provides a fast dispatching system that allows any number of
interested parties to subscribe to events, or "signals".

Signal receivers can subscribe to specific senders or receive signals
sent by any sender.

  >>> from blinker import signal
  >>> started = signal('round-started')
  >>> def each(round):
  ...     print "Round %s!" % round
  ...
  >>> started.connect(each)

  >>> def round_two(round):
  ...     print "This is round two."
  ...
  >>> started.connect(round_two, sender=2)

  >>> for round in range(1, 4):
  ...     started.send(round)
  ...
  Round 1!
  Round 2!
  This is round two.
  Round 3!
